# aut2ltl — Working Notes for Claude

## Project layout (nested root package `aut2ltl/`)
Layering, acyclic: `aut2ltl/contract.py` (LTLResult/Translator floor) +
`aut2ltl/language.py` ← `aut2ltl/bls` (pure cascade FoSSaCS engine) +
`aut2ltl/daisy` (pure self-loop peel) + `aut2ltl/partscc` (single-terminal-SCC
leaf) + `aut2ltl/heur` (extracted heuristics, e.g. `fuse2`) + `aut2ltl/decomp`
((de)composition approaches, one isolated subpackage each: `scc` / `strength` /
`acceptance` / `inv`) ← `aut2ltl/portfolio` (combinators: build / builder recipes)
← `aut2ltl/__main__` + `__init__`. Engine-agnostic helpers in `aut2ltl/ltl`
(metrics, printers, simplify). Tests under `tests/` (`survey*`, `tests/bls`,
`tests/heur`, `tests/fixtures`).

## Orientation (don't duplicate here — follow the pointers)
- `README.md` — repo guide / quick start. `STATUS.md` / `TODO.md` — project
  snapshot / open items.
- `aut2ltl/bls/README.md` — kr engine entry point: doc map, pipeline, module map,
  testing tools. `aut2ltl/bls/STATUS.md` — **current** engine state (read to start).
  `aut2ltl/bls/TODO.md` — engine work items.
- `docs/HISTORY.md` — construction log (the dated DONE/WIRED/LANDED/reverted
  record). Reference for the *why/when*; **do NOT read it to start a session** —
  STATUS.md is the current snapshot.
- `docs/algorithm.md` — the construction's scope/policy and module mapping.
  `docs/dag_folding.md` — the size-explosion analysis (open research direction).
- `paper/automata-to-ltl-construction.md` — the construction reference.
- `paper/Automata2LTL.txt` — ground truth for any formula-fidelity question
  (Sec 4.2 + Table 1 + Formulas 3/4/5 ≈ lines 440–1040). LLM summaries have twice
  introduced guard/case errors; the paper text settles disputes.
- The default translator is the `best_daisy2` recipe in `aut2ltl/portfolio/builder.py`
  (strength/acceptance decomposition over a daisy/daisy2 peel flooring on the `bls`
  cascade); `aut2ltl/portfolio/README.md` maps the package. The kr core stays pure.

## Discipline (mandatory)
- One commit per file (preference). The exception is a mechanical bulk change —
  code moved/renamed, a regex sweep, a baseline-log regeneration — which commits
  together. Otherwise commit freely without fretting over intermediate states
  (we are solo on `master`, so intermediate states are private). The commit
  message explains *the change*.
- **Committing** needs the user's go-ahead, then walk the files. **Pushing** is
  separate and ALWAYS asked for every time (no auto-approve): push only once the
  work is stable and the gates below have passed.
- Remember that git operations like `git mv` or `git rm` already populate the
  index. So always follow them with a commit *before* attempting to add any
  modified file to index.
- Commit directly to `master` (we do not branch). Never run branch / cross-branch
  diagnostics.
- `docs/HISTORY.md` is APPEND-ONLY via shell (`cat >>` / `printf >>`) and is
  NEVER read (it is large — STATUS.md is the snapshot). Record the *why/when* of a
  landed change there.
- NO persistent "memory" files: the user does not use them (not inspectable in the
  repo, they bloat unseen). Capture anything durable in STATUS / TODO / a README /
  this file instead — all git-inspectable.
- Update STATUS/TODO *before* committing a code change *when the change is a
  STATUS-level state shift or closes a TODO item*; a one-off bug fix that is
  neither belongs only in `docs/HISTORY.md`.
- Test BEFORE commit, via placed scripts under `tests/` only (no /tmp, no
  `python -c` one-liners), under timeout:
  - `python3 tests/bls/test_kr_r4_audit.py` → must stay CLEAN
  - `python3 tests/survey.py` → must end **SUCCESS** (no verified non-equivalent
    answer; spot timeouts / size explosions are not failures)
- When comparing languages, report containment direction + witness word
  (`tests/bls/ltl_diff.py`), not just equivalence.
- Debug method: ground sub-terms against GT automata built from D's semiautomaton
  (`tests/bls/trace_fin_semantics.py` pattern), find the first diverging sub-term,
  fix against the paper text.
- Keep files roughly under 500 LOC (technical cores like the mutually-recursive
  formula cluster or parsers may exceed).

## Working style (how the user wants me to operate)
- **Diagnostics self-bound, ≤15s PER EXAMPLE.** Hard cap on any test/diagnostic
  run; a blown timeout IS a finding, report it. The cap is per example — do NOT
  batch many cases into one run to dodge it (give probes a single-input argv and
  invoke once per case). Redirect long output to `tests/**/logs/` (never /tmp),
  don't pipe long runs to `tail`.
- **No manual process management.** Never `kill`/`pkill`, no `&`/`nohup`/`$!`, no
  inspecting pids. For long self-terminating runs use the Monitor tool or Bash
  `run_in_background` (the harness tracks the task and re-invokes on completion);
  wait on completion events, never sleep/poll loops.
- **Spot is bounded-or-skipped, never waited on** in the construction/test path —
  no unbounded external calls; Spot is for hash-consing (+ the bounded oracles
  already accepted). A stall is reported, not blocked on.
- **Honest failure attribution.** Distinguish what WE failed at (a crash, a
  construction timeout with no DAG) from what a downstream tool can't handle (Spot
  hitting >32 acceptance sets, the flat form exploding). A DAG we built that Spot
  can't verify is NOT our failure.
- **Present intermediate results.** Stop and show results after each step; do not
  start a new direction without user validation.
- **Type the signatures.** Add explicit Python type annotations (params + return)
  on new/touched functions — the user comes from Java/C++. Use `typing`
  (`Optional`/`Callable`/`Protocol`/forward-ref strings), `TYPE_CHECKING` for
  annotation-only imports; `Protocol` for behavioral contracts (see `Translator`).
