# Construction history (aut2ltl)

The dated, narrative record of how the construction reached its current state —
the "DONE / WIRED / LANDED / tried-and-reverted" log. **Not needed to start a
session** (read `aut2ltl/kr/STATUS.md` for current state; this file is the
archive). Moved out of STATUS.md on 2026-06-14 (P-ARCH step 11).

## Folding & simplification passes (2026-06-12)

- **Letter fusion (the "B" iteration — dag_folding.md counter-measure B, default
  ON, `KR_FUSE_LETTERS=0` restores the per-letter literal shape).** At every
  enumeration site (solid⁺/wsolid⁺ last-step/leave/bad-pre, dashed
  enter_t/enter_b/line-3, fin's `_uncond_reach_strict`) the summand reads the
  letter only through its guard, so letters are grouped by the `_dedupe` key minus
  `li` (enter sites key on the arrival too) and each group emits ONE summand whose
  guard is the Minato-minimized OR (`_fuse_or` in ltl_builders: BDD round-trip via
  `spot.formula_to_bdd`/`bdd_to_formula`, process-lifetime bdd_dict, plain-Or
  fallback). One tail per outcome class instead of per letter — the distinct-tail
  driver shrinks at the source. Soundness argument: dag_folding.md "Letter fusion".
  Measured: `XXa`/`XXXa` collapse to the LITERAL formulas (3/4 tree nodes; XXXa was
  SPOT_TIMEOUT); `Xa` output is `Xa`; `G(a->Xb)` tree 3.6M→22.6k and distinct
  temporal 226→85 (under the 32-acc-set cap → equiv=True); `G(p->(qUr))` tree
  84.8M→55k, 559→121; `G(a->Xa)` 5.1×10¹¹→11.3M; `(a U b)|Gc` 2⁶⁰-saturated→528M;
  `X(a&Xa)` 6.3×10¹³→3.1×10¹⁰ (the remaining ladder wall). Survey: 3 cases flipped
  to True (`XXXa`, `G(a->Xb)`, `Ga|Gb`), zero regressions; grounding: zero
  contradictions; audit CLEAN. Post-fusion log: `kr/testing/logs/fusion_measure_dag_*`.

- **Own rewrite pass wired (the "1c" iteration — kr/simplify/ package,
  KR_SIMP_OWN=1 default, size cap KR_SIMP_OWN_LIMIT=2000, KR_SIMP_OWN_FACTOR toggles
  rule 3).** Three rules Spot lacks (validated standalone 44/44 + 1500-formula
  random fuzz ALL EQUIVALENT, oracle self-tested): (1) context pass —
  sibling-context propagation over the boolean skeleton, identity domination incl.
  temporal nodes, Shannon at Or, reset at temporal boundaries; (2) now-evaluation —
  one-step unroll of G/F/U/R/W/M heads under boolean context (initial-state
  knowledge, Bonneland et al. lineage), two-tier entailment (identity + BDD);
  (3) sound partial factoring + Minato guard groups. Hooked per node in `_simp_f`
  after Spot's pass (one bounded Spot re-pass when rules fire); persistent package
  memos make it amortized O(1) per distinct node; ONE shared bdd_dict per process (a
  second dict next to the fusion one corrupted the equiv-child heap). The size cap
  exists because the uncapped pass sent 3 reactivity cases CONSTRUCT_TIMEOUT —
  capped, all construction times are healthy. Measured (capped, vs post-fusion):
  `Ga`→`a & G(!a|Xa)`, `Fa`→`a | F(!a&Xa)`, `a&Xa`→literal `a & Xa`; `G(a->Xb)` tree
  22.6k→12.2k; `G(p->(qUr))` 55k→38.7k; `G(a->Xa)` 11.3M→2.0M; `(aUb)|Gc` 528M→7.7M;
  giants barely move under the cap (`X(a&Xa)` 31G→27.9G). Survey 24 True / 0 FALSE;
  audit CLEAN; grounding zero contradictions. KNOWN regression: rewriting creates
  temporal-body VARIANTS that coexist across branches, raising the
  distinct-eventuality census — `F(a&Xb)` went back over the 32-acc cap (its equiv
  child then dies in the abort path's teardown: `free(): invalid pointer` — infra,
  not semantic). Refinement item: eventuality-aware rewriting (TODO 1c).

- **Unroll-inverse fold pass (the "rule 4" iteration — kr/simplify/fold_pass.py,
  KR_SIMP_OWN_FOLD=1 default).** Eight pair-folds (expansion laws backwards,
  arbitrary subformulas): `c|XFc→Fc`, `c&XGc→Gc`, U/W/R/M one-step forms,
  first-occurrence `c|F(¬c&Xc)→Fc`, induction `c&G(¬c|Xc)→Gc`; plus S1/S2 sibling
  subsumption (Formula-5 line redundancy): `c|X(cRd)|G(c|Xd)→c|X(cRd)` and dual
  `c&X(cUd)&F(c&Xd)→c&X(cUd)` (proofs in module docstring; M/W variants UNSOUND,
  regression-tested; the one-step-SHIFTED ladder variants are genuinely not
  redundant — witness `!a; a; cycle{!a}`). Validated: test_fold_pass 26/26, all
  suites CLEAN, fuzz 3×500 ALL EQUIVALENT zero growth, audit CLEAN. Measured (vs
  post-1c): `F(a&Xa)` census 55→33 / tree 4611→901 / DAG 269→156; `F(a&Xb)` 109→87;
  `G(a|Xb)` 94→82; `G(a->Xa)` 193→147, tree 2.0M→1.5M. Survey: **`G(a->Xb)` flipped
  SPOT_TIMEOUT→True (25 True / 0 FALSE)**, `(aUb)|Gc` 7.7M→6.6M, `X(a&Xa)`
  flatten-gate census 23.1G→13.3G (NB measure_formula_dag's unfolded count for that
  case moved 52.6M→127M — fold changes memo keys and thus the construction path; DAG
  and temporal census both improved). Diagnosis tool: `kr/testing/probe_dag_dump.py`
  (let-binding DAG view + temporal census; the F(a&Xa) dumps that drove the rules are
  in `kr/testing/logs/faxa_dag_dump*.txt`).

- **Per-DAG-node memoized simplification (the "A" iteration).** `_simp_f`
  simplifies each hash-consed node ONCE (id-keyed memo + the shared tl_simplifier's
  internal cache); operators build bottom-up so every call sees already-simplified
  children. Policy `KR_SIMP_OPTS`: hybrid (default) = Spot's full rules only on nodes
  with unfolded size ≤ `KR_SIMP_FULL_LIMIT` (2000), basics (constant folding, X(0)→0)
  above — full's syntactic-implication pass is pairwise and sharing-blind and stalled
  >15s per-node on `X(a&Xa)`, basics never stalls. `KR_SIMP_NODE=0` = old identity
  behavior. Paired with the dead-tail early-out in reach_strong (`reach(…,τ≡false) ≡
  false`, the Table-1 base case), folded tails delete their memo-key subtrees.
  Measured: `a&Xa` 752→311 subproblems; `G(a->Xb)` distinct temporal 538→226,
  unfolded tree 85.5M→3.6M; `G(p->(qUr))` distinct temporal 4115→559 (7.4x); `X(a&Xa)`
  max tail 177x smaller (counts −20% only — the residual is genuine b^k wrapping, see
  dag_folding.md). We still never WAIT on Spot: each call is one node with simplified
  children, and the escape hatch drops Spot from the path entirely.

## Census reduction (2026-06-13)

- **Initial-state opening + context-aware subsumption.** Three additions on top of
  rule 4. (i) Context OPENING (context_pass): temporal siblings feed their
  now-component into the context — Gφ asserts conj(φ), R/M assert conj(g); at Or, Fφ
  refutes disj(φ), U/W refute disj(g). Opened facts flow ONE-WAY (earlier→later in
  canonical child order): bidirectional opening built circular support and was caught
  UNSOUND by fuzz (witness `!(b R (Gb & (b M Gb)))` → 0; the opened b erased the
  sibling b while the M consumed it) — one-way is sound by sequential replacement;
  regression cases in test_context_pass. (ii) G/F ABSORPTION (fold_pass): conjuncts
  implied by a sibling Gφ dropped (small recursive entailment: X/F/G bodies, U/M arms,
  And/Or), dual at Or. (iii) **Context-aware S1/S2** (fold_pass.ctx_subsume, hooked as
  bool_hook into the context pass): under ctx ⊨ ¬c the S1 bare-c case is discharged by
  knowledge, so the unshifted AND the one-step-SHIFTED ladder forms fold — the shapes
  that are provably NOT redundant in isolation. **This pushed `F(a&Xa)` under the
  32-acc cap: census 33→26, Spot equiv True end-to-end.** Measured: `F(a&Xa)` DAG
  156→111, tree 901→453; `F(a&Xb)` census 87→74; `G(a|Xb)` 82→79, tree 6.8k→3.1k;
  survey `X(a&Xa)` flatten census 13.3G→1.5G. Gates: suites 19/18/10/38 CLEAN, fuzz
  3×500 ALL EQUIVALENT, audit CLEAN, survey 25 True / 0 FALSE. Known limitation:
  one-way flow + canonical order misses openings whose source sorts after the target
  (alternating direction across the pipeline's repeated context passes would be sound —
  TODO).

- **Census anatomy + arm-padding removal.** Two probes answered "where does the
  residual census live?" conclusively (`probe_census_classes`, `probe_muller_overlap`
  — both committed): (i) the post-rules census is ~all genuinely distinct languages
  (F(a&Xa) 26/26 classes, F(a&Xb) 74→73, G(a->Xa) 144→≤126), so formula-level interning
  has little headroom; (ii) the Muller DNF is NOT the driver — disjuncts share 83% of
  the census via hash-consing (G(p->(qUr)): two disjuncts, 77 census each, overlap 70,
  whole 84); (iii) **the Fin(C)/¬Fin terms ARE the driver**: per disjunct the two Fin
  conjuncts carry census ~50 each (DAG ~285 each) while the reach/invariant part is ~25
  — including a census-1 conjunct that is LITERALLY language-equivalent to the target
  body (`p -> (q U r)` verified): the construction contains the small answer, buried
  under the Muller-acceptance scaffolding. This is the evidence base for P1 (direct
  Σ₁/Π₁/Π₂/Σ₂ acceptance dispatch instead of the Muller DNF). Spin-off rule from the
  class probe (fold_pass, validated 42/42 + fuzz): **U/W/R arm-padding removal** —
  `(c & Xd) U g → c U g` when c ⇒ d and g ⇒ d (the Xd is implied by the U dynamics; dual
  for R; propositional-fragment entailment, sound one-way): G(p->(qUr)) census 98→84. NB
  the formula must be written `q U r` WITH SPACES — `qUr` parses as ONE atomic
  proposition (an earlier "solved at 21 nodes" reading of this case was that artifact).

- **Config-graph reach FALSE-cut: tried, NEGATIVE, reverted.** Hypothesis: prune
  `reach_strong(S,·,·,T,·)` to `false` when the target is graph-unreachable from the
  source in the config automaton — a cheap, exact, Spot-free cut at the source of the
  σ∧Xτ ladder. Two corrections shrank it to nothing. (1) Soundness: the paper's avoid
  is β-guarded and STRICT-BEFORE arrival (`∀j∈[0..i). δ≠B ∨ w⊭β`, Automata2LTL.txt:573),
  so `T==B` does NOT imply false and walling B in the BFS is unsound — only avoid-FREE
  target reachability is sound. (2) The cut must be SUFFIX-projected, not full-config:
  at recursion level k the target is matched on `T[k:]` (the `level==n` base is `(¬β)Uτ`,
  dropping T), so a full-config cut is the k=0 case and is unsound at k>0. A read-only
  probe over the helper memo showed 30% "cuttable" full-config — but ~all of that was the
  unsound over-cut; the sound suffix-projected cut fires ~104×/41584 on `Xa & XXa` and
  changes DAG/tree/temporal census by ZERO, likewise zero on
  `G(a->Xb)`/`G(p->(qUr))`/`F(a&Xb)`/`Ga|Gb` (audit CLEAN, all equiv True throughout).
  Diagnosis, consistent with the census-anatomy finding above: the explosion lives in the
  **Fin(C) acceptance scaffolding, not in reach** — its redundancy is β/τ-obligation-driven,
  invisible to graph reachability. The free-tail collapse the user is after needs a
  Fin(C)-level recognizer (config in an absorbing accepting class ⇒ constant Fin term), not
  a reach cut. All code reverted; finding kept here.

- **Per-conjunct Fin-reachability fold: LANDED (the Fin(C)-level recognizer the bullet
  above asks for — generalizes and replaces the absorbing-M fold).**
  `config_graph.configs_reachable_from(casc, M)` (delegated via `Cascade`, consumed in
  `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style`; default on, `KR_FOLD_FIN_REACH=0` restores the full
  Muller term). For a good Muller set M, keep `Fin(C∉M)` **only for C reachable from M**
  in the config graph; drop it for every C off M's forward cone. Soundness (per term):
  the `¬Fin(C∈M)` conjuncts force Inf⊇M, and the i.o.-set of a path in a finite digraph
  is **strongly connected**, so any C∈Inf is reachable from M within Inf; contrapositive,
  C unreachable from M ⟹ C∉Inf ⟹ `Fin(C)` — implied, droppable. Pure graph property, no
  containment check. **Subsumes the absorbing-M fold** (M absorbing ⟺ reach(M)=M ⟹ all
  `Fin(C∉M)` drop) and fires where absorbing did not (non-bottom M with a side/transient C
  off its cone). Two wins: (i) it prunes more conjuncts AND (ii) the kept-config set is
  decided BEFORE building `fin_c` — the explosive part — so dropped configs cost zero
  construction. **It bites the distinct-temporal census (the 32-acc driver), not just the
  unfolded tree** — unlike absorbing-only. Measured, no-fold→per-conjunct (absorbing-only
  in parens), `logs/survey_sizes_perconj_2026-06-13`: `a U b` tree 87→13 / temporals 4→1 →
  the LITERAL `b | ((a&!b) U (a&!b&Xb))`; **`F(a&Xb)` tree 4251→2739 / temporals 74→64
  (absorbing: 74, no change)**; `(aUb)|Gc` 637→525 / 22→18 (abs 19); `Ga|Gb` 7026→6438 /
  47→46 (abs: no change); `Fa&Gb` 187→159 / 12→11 (abs: no change); `G(a->Xa)` 144→141;
  `X(a&Xa)` 4138→4134. Still over the cap where they were (`F(a&Xb)` 64>32), but the census
  is now moving on reach-driven cases. Audit CLEAN; survey 0 fail / no regressions. Open:
  the cap cases need deeper census reduction (the kept `¬Fin(M)` / reachable-`Fin` part
  still dominates — census-anatomy finding).

## Acceptance dispatch — direct hierarchy-class φ per Theorem 2 / §9.3 (2026-06-13)

- **Büchi class WIRED on the default path. The structural fix the census-anatomy finding
  pointed to.** `kr/acceptance_dispatch.py` `reconstruct_buchi(casc)`: a deterministic
  **Büchi** cascade (`acc=Inf(0)`, `Π₂`) gets the DIRECT form `φ := ⋁_{C∈α} ¬Fin(C)` — NO
  `Fin(C∉G)` web and NO good-set enumeration (the two Muller-DNF explosions). Soundness:
  `¬Fin(C)` ≡ "C∈inf-set"; the inf-set is strongly connected, so Büchi `inf∩α≠∅` ≡
  `⋁_{C∈α}¬Fin(C)` (a transient accepting C ⇒ `¬Fin`≡false, harmless).
  - **Wiring:** a TOP-LEVEL pre-check at the head of `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style` (gate
    `KR_DISPATCH_BUCHI`, default ON; `=0` restores pure Muller for A/B). The hook lives
    THERE — not in `reconstruct_bls` — because the GOTO decompose front end
    (`reconstruct_decomposed`) calls `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style` directly per piece; the
    single pre-check covers BOTH entries. Single-condition decompose pieces are exactly
    Büchi/coBüchi, so the dispatch fires per piece (e.g. `GFa&GFb&GFc` and(3): each conjunct
    dispatches).
  - **α is COVER-AWARE** (`config_graph.buchi_accepting_configs`, delegated via `Cascade`):
    read off `build_pruned_config_aut` — every reachable config whose lifted (sbacc) marks
    satisfy the same `g.acc()` oracle `accepting_sc_subsets` uses — NOT the lift-section
    `accepting_configs()` (one config per state). The lift section UNDER-approximates on a
    genuine holonomy cover: wiring first flipped `F(a&Xb)` to equiv=FALSE (`L(buchi)⊊L(orig)`,
    α missed the duplicated accepting sink), the cover reader gives the exact α={(1,1),(1,2)}.
  - **Results (size A/B on the decompose path, `logs/sizes_dispatch_{on,off}_2026-06-13`):**
    `G(p->(qUr))` 84→**14** (tree 20291→751, UNDER the cap → survey equiv=True — the
    challenge case); `G(a->Xa)` 141→30 (tree 1.53M→703); `G(a->Xb)` 79→23; `F(a&Xb)` 64→40;
    `Ga|Gb` 46→18; `GFa` 10→3; `GFa&GFb` 20→6; `GFa&GFb&GFc` 30→9; `X(a&Xa)` 4134→2069 (still
    over the flatten gate — reach-driven). Totals over 35 cases: DAG 61029→47498 (−22%),
    distinct temporals 10907→8491 (−22%); excluding the two giants the tractable cases drop
    578→227 (−61%). **Survey (`logs/survey_wire_buchi_2026-06-13`): 0/35 equiv=FALSE, four
    walls flipped True (`G(p->(qUr))`, `F(a&Xb)`, `G(a->Xa)`, `GFa&GFb&GFc`), zero
    regressions; audit CLEAN.**

- **coBüchi class WIRED, the mirror of Büchi.** `reconstruct_cobuchi(casc)`: a deterministic
  **coBüchi** (persistence, `Σ₂`) cascade gets `φ := ⋀_{C∈α} Fin(C)` (α = the "visit
  finitely"/marked configs) — exact, since coBüchi acceptance is `Inf(ρ)∩Marked=∅` ≡
  `⋀ Fin(C)` (a transient marked C ⇒ `Fin`≡true, harmless). Wired as a SECOND pre-check after
  Büchi in `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style` (gate `KR_DISPATCH_COBUCHI`, default ON). α =
  `config_graph.cobuchi_finite_configs` — the cover-aware DUAL of the Büchi reader. **GATE
  SUBTLETY (the crux, found UNDER decomposition):** `decompose_aut`'s parity step turns the
  natural `Fin(0)` into `Inf(0)|Fin(1)`, on which `acc().is_co_buchi()` is False; the gate
  recovers the natural acceptance via `postprocess(.,"deterministic","generic")` and tests
  `is_co_buchi` there. The `postprocess(.,"coBuchi")` variant is UNSOUND — a recurrence
  cascade (`GFa`) passes it. **Results (`logs/sizes_dispatch_cobuchi_2026-06-13`):** `FGa`
  6→3 temporals, `F(a&Gb)` 7→4, `FGa|FGb` **6195→2779** (tree 1.15×10¹⁸→3.23×10¹⁷ — census
  >½ off, still over the flatten gate so UNVERIFIED, the residual is reach-driven), and the
  reactivity `(GFa&FGb)` 10→7 (its `FGb` AND-piece dispatches). Totals over 35 cases DAG
  47498→28207, distinct temporals 8491→5066 (both −40%). Survey
  (`logs/survey_wire_cobuchi_2026-06-13`): 0/35 equiv=FALSE; audit CLEAN.

- **weak/looping (Δ₁/Σ₁/Π₁) WIRED but OFF by default (`KR_DISPATCH_WEAK`, the experimental
  A/B baseline).** `reconstruct_weak(casc)` = `⋁ over accepting SCC G : end_in(G)`, with
  `end_in(G) = (⋁_{C∈H} reach_to(ι,C)) ∧ (⋀_{C'∈G'} ¬reach_to(ι,C'))` — pure `reach_to`
  (`reach_strong(ι,C,⊥,C,⊤)`), NO Fin; subsumes looping-Büchi (safety `⋀¬reach_to(sink)`) and
  looping-coBüchi (guarantee `⋁reach_to(sink)`). Gate `is_weak_cascade` =
  `is_weak_automaton(postprocess(.,"generic"))`. Placed BEFORE Büchi/coBüchi. Correct
  (flag-on survey 0/35 equiv=FALSE) but a SIZE REGRESSION and therefore kept OFF —
  `probe_weak_dispatch` / `probe_looping_dispatch`: the general form is worse on 6/7 cases;
  dedicated looping is mixed (2 wins `Ga|Gb` 18→14, `F(a&Xb)` 40→30; 3 losses `G(a->Xa)` tree
  703→6263, `G(a->Xb)` 23→30, `a U b` 1→3). Root cause: weak languages are already handled
  smaller by Büchi/coBüchi, and the residual is **reach-driven** (the τ-tail), which NO
  acceptance form touches. Kept in (flagged off) as the A/B baseline for `Acc(c)`.

- **Config-indexed `Acc(c)` for the BOUNDED fragment — WIRED, default ON. Cracks the
  `X(a&Xa)` reach wall: UNVERIFIED 5.1×10⁸ → equiv=True, literal output.**
  `reconstruct_acc(casc)` (`KR_DISPATCH_ACC`, default ON, FIRST in the dispatch chain).
  `φ := Acc(ι)` by bounded unroll of the config graph: `Acc(c) = ⊤` if `L(D from state_of(c))`
  is universal, `⊥` if empty (R1, a small Spot ⊤/⊥ oracle on the INPUT automaton D — lazy +
  cached, NOT on the output); else `⋁_σ guard(σ) ∧ X Acc(move_config(c,σ))` (R2 unroll).
  **SELF-GATING:** a config re-entered on the unroll path that is not ⊤/⊥ is recurrent ⇒ Acc
  declines (None ⇒ caller falls back to the Büchi/coBüchi/Muller chain), so it fires only on
  the bottom/bounded class. It bypasses the reach machinery entirely (no reach_to, no Fin, no
  τ-tail), emitting the literal formula. Complexity `O(|reachable configs| × |Σ|)` memoized
  builds plus ≤ n bounded oracle calls on the small `D`. Measured (`probe_acc_dispatch`):
  `X(a&Xa)` BLS 11835/5.1×10⁸/2069 → Acc **4/5/0**, equiv True; the whole X-ladder collapses
  to the literal; every recurrent control declines → BLS. **Survey
  (`logs/survey_wire_acc_2026-06-13`): the ONLY verdict change is `X(a&Xa)` UNVERIFIED→True;
  0/35 FALSE, zero regressions; audit CLEAN.** Scope (`probe_acc_fuzz`, 3×60 randltl): gate
  rate ~24% but fired cases are almost all TRIVIAL; the high-value deep-bounded case is a rare
  tail. Kept ON (cheap, self-declining, only thing that reaches the bounded reach wall).
  Caveat: Spot ⊤/⊥ oracle in the construction path (bounded, small input) — a structural
  sink-reachability test could replace it (TODO).

## Decompose-and-recombine at the root — LANDED + made the GOTO path (2026-06-13)

`kr/decompose_recombine.py` (orthogonal module, core untouched). ROOT-level language
operations recombine kr outputs soundly with no caveats (kr is language-faithful, a root
operator is a pure position-0 language op): `L(A)=⋃L(Aᵢ) ⟹ ⋁ kr(Aᵢ) ≡ L(A)` and dually
`L(A)=⋂L(Aᵢ) ⟹ ⋀ kr(Aᵢ) ≡ L(A)`. `reconstruct_decomposed(aut)` (AUTOMATON-in) normalizes to
a DETERMINISTIC, STATE-MINIMAL GENERIC automaton, then dispatches:
- `_to_split_form`: `postprocess(aut,"deterministic","generic")` (keeps the conjunctive
  `⋀Inf`/Streett shape) THEN `sat_minimize` (gated `KR_SAT_MIN_STATES`). State minimality is
  load-bearing: kr's census is acutely sensitive to the input state count. `GFa&FGb`:
  `postprocess` alone leaves 2 states whose pieces explode (recombined tree 9.5e15);
  `sat_minimize` recovers the 1-state form (tree 313) — PURELY on the automaton
  (`probe_min_detgeneric`).
- **AND by acceptance set** (`acc().get_acceptance().top_conjuncts()`): for a DETERMINISTIC
  automaton each word has one run, so `acc=⋀cᵢ ⟹ L=⋂L(A|cᵢ)` exactly; one single-condition
  sub-automaton per conjunct (clone via HOA round-trip), recombine with `⋀`.
- **OR by strength** (`decompose_scc` weak/terminal/strong, Renault TACAS'13): union is the
  language; recombine with `⋁`.
- else single condition → existing monolithic kr.
Each piece runs the EXISTING `decompose_aut`+`reconstruct` (Fin web collapses to a singleton
good-set), so the Muller ∨/∧ is hoisted out of the Fin web to the root — no hand-coding the
§9.3 Σ/Π/Δ forms. Decompose-path survey (`logs/survey_decompose_2026-06-13.txt`) vs the
monolithic baseline: **0 of 8 two-level cases fail equiv, zero regressions, four
acceptance-driven walls flip UNVERIFIED→True plus a new 7-level case verifies**:

| case | split | monolithic | decompose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GFa&GFb` | and(2) | UNVERIFIED 9.08×10¹⁶ | **True** (tree 111, 20 temporals) |
| `(aUb)\|Gc` | or(2) | UNVERIFIED 6.97M | **True** (637) |
| `(GFa&FGb)` | and(2) | UNVERIFIED 2⁶⁰ | **True** |
| `GFa->GFb` | and | (n/a) | **True** |
| `G(a->Fb)&G(c->Fd)` | and(2) | (new) | **True** at L=7 |
| `Ga\|Fb` | or(2) | True (tree 499) | **True** (tree 21, 2 temporals) |
| `GFa&GFb&GFc` | and(3) | can't build | SPOT_TIMEOUT (cap); compositional **SOUND** |

Verification at scale: for n≥3 the recombined `⋀` trips Spot's 32-acc cap, so the sound
witness is COMPOSITIONAL — `kr(pieceᵢ) ≡ L(pieceᵢ)` per single-Büchi piece, which by
`L(A)=⋂L(pieceᵢ)` gives `⋀kr(pieceᵢ) ≡ L(A)` without translating the product
(`probe_and_decompose.py`). KNOWN LIMITATIONS (acceptance ABSORPTION blocks both splits):
`GFa&Gb` (recurrence ∧ safety) and `FGa|FGb` (persistence union) — Spot's determinization
folds the second component into a single acceptance set / strength, so the split sees one
piece (`none`). The principled fix (expose the absorbed component) is blocked by that folding
— since carried by the buchi2ltl gate (below).

## buchi2ltl heuristic gate + portfolio (2026-06-14)

- **buchi2ltl heuristic gate — WIRED into the decompose dispatcher, default ON. Cracks the
  last MP wall `FGa|FGb`; the MP survey is now a clean sweep.** `kr/heuristic_gate.py`
  `try_heuristic_gate(aut)` is the SINGLE seam between the two paths (the kr core operators
  import nothing from `buchi2ltl/`; the old "never mix" rule is retired). **Gate goes UNDER
  decomposition (`KR_GATE_UNDER_DECOMP`, default ON):** `decompose_recombine` splits FIRST and
  applies the gate only to the leaves that no longer split — so a decomposable input is always
  cut into pieces, even when the gate could take the whole. Exception: when the ROOT does not
  split, the gate runs on the RAW (pre-determinization) input. This makes the reported
  technique honest: a case `split_report` says `or(2)` now actually decomposes (`tech=or+sl`).
  Size effect is a wash (DAG 494→491, temporal 114→119).
  - **Soundness is a composition of sound steps, NO per-call equiv check:** arbitrary HOA
    →(Spot `postprocess` to TGBA, language-preserving)→ buchi2ltl. buchi2ltl's CORE is `sl`
    (self-loop backward labeling) — an EXACT state-elimination translation on the very-weak
    (1-weak) fragment, DECLINING (`UNSUPPORTED`) elsewhere; its f2/t2 layer is a separate
    verify-before-use guess-and-check. So adopted output is sound by construction. The bounded
    equiv check is an OPT-IN audit (`KR_GATE_VERIFY`, default OFF). **Audited at scale
    (`fuzz_gate_decompose.py`, VERIFY=1, 3 seeds ≈170 randltl / 191 piece-adoptions): 0
    equiv=FALSE, 0 rejections, ~81% adopt rate** (`logs/fuzz_gate_seed{1,2,3}_2026-06-14`).
  - **Why determinize-then-gate is NOT enough (`probe_gate_redet.py`):** buchi2ltl's backward
    labeling exploits the (often nondeterministic) translate-style TGBA, which
    `_to_split_form`'s determinization destroys. `FGa|FGb` goes raw 3-state nondet Büchi
    (buchi2ltl ok tree=13) → det 2-state coBüchi → re-projected 4-state nondet Büchi that
    buchi2ltl DECLINES — a one-way loss. Hence the gate runs on the RAW input exactly when the
    root does not split.
  - **Adopted output is simplified through `_simp_f`** (buchi2ltl does not wire Spot's LTL
    simplifier; `Fa|Gb` raw 5-temporal → 2-temporal). `probe_gate_inspect.py` shows
    before/after.
  - **Results (gate ON vs OFF, `logs/survey_sizes_gate_{on,off}_2026-06-14`):** `FGa|FGb`
    **2779→3** (tree 3.2×10¹⁷→6 — the last wall collapses); `G(a->Xb)` 23→1; `G(a->Xa)` 30→2;
    `Ga|Gb` 18→3; `GFa->GFb` 19→4; `GFa&GFb&GFc` tree 46→8 / 9→4; `(aUb)|Gc` 9→3; `Fa&Gb` 7→2.
    Totals over 35 cases: distinct temporals **2997→114 (−96%)**, DAG 16376→494, tree
    3.2×10¹⁷→1951. **Zero regressions.**
  - **Gates:** r4 audit CLEAN; MP survey `logs/survey_gate_buchi2ltl_2026-06-14` **0/35
    equiv=FALSE, every case True**. Gate `KR_GATE_BUCHI2LTL` (default ON). Side-by-side:
    `testing/run_mp_through_buchi2ltl.py` (30/35 handled standalone, 0 FALSE).

- **Portfolio result struct (`kr.recon_result.ReconResult`).** kr is now a portfolio (gate /
  and-split / or-split / acc / weak / buchi / cobuchi / bls-Muller), so `reconstruct_decomposed`
  returns a `ReconResult` (`.formula` + `.technique`, a deduped SET of method tags) instead of a
  bare formula. buchi2ltl's `reconstruct_ltl` returns the SAME struct. The set is threaded by
  reference down the dispatch (MT-safe). Wired into both surveys' `tech=` column.

- **Contract reification — `status` (P-ARCH step 1).** `ReconResult` gained an explicit
  `status` (OK / DECLINED) with `ReconResult.decline()` / `.declined` / `.ok`; "not me" is no
  longer the `UNSUPPORTED` string smuggled inside `.formula` (engines still use that string
  INTERNALLY in their recursion — translated to DECLINED at the boundary return of
  `reconstruct_ltl`). Consumers branch on `.declined`. The `Translator` Protocol (callable
  `twa -> ReconResult`; invariant: language-faithful OR declines, never wrong) is documented in
  the contract module. Gates: r4 audit CLEAN, MP survey clean sweep
  (`logs/survey_parch_step1_2026-06-14.txt`).

- **kr UNDER sl — full-suffix delegation prototype (`kr/sl_driven.py` + one optional
  `buchi2ltl` hook). The mirror of the decompose gate.** `reconstruct_sl_driven(aut)` runs sl
  as the DRIVER; at any multi-state-SCC state it delegates the whole sub-automaton A_q to the
  normal `reconstruct_decomposed` and reattaches the label. Seam: optional `scc_labeler`
  callback on the DAG-native engine `reconstruct_ltl` (the labeler returns a `spot.formula` DAG,
  spliced as a child node WITHOUT flattening). Termination: delegated kr uses the sl GATE (no
  labeler) → declines the core → cascade; never re-enters the driver. Soundness: the delegated
  label is L(A_q) = exactly the language sl's own label(q) represents (`probe_sl_compose`: 0
  equiv=FALSE). Results: `XX(G(a->Fb))` kr-on-full 5596 DAG / **1.2×10¹⁴ tree** → sl-driven
  **21 nodes**; `c U (G(a->Fb))` kr-on-full TIMEOUT → **28**; `XX(F(a&Xb))` 2957 DAG / 1.1×10⁹
  tree → 183. **Boundary flattening RESOLVED (buchi2ltl is now DAG-native):** `reconstruct_ltl`
  builds a hash-consed `spot.formula` DAG end to end (t2 fragments included); the `scc_labeler`
  returns the kr DAG directly (no `str()`). The DAG engine was cross-oracled against the (now
  deleted) string engine across the MP ladder + randltl with 0 divergences. Not wired into any
  default path (a top-level chooser + scale soundness fuzz are later steps).

## Representation / verification probes (dead ends, kept as record)

- **Object-out API landed (P0 plumbing, 2026-06-12).** With reconstruct returning the DAG and
  harnesses flattening only under `KR_FLATTEN_TREE_LIMIT` (survey default 5M tree nodes), the
  former CONSTRUCT_TIMEOUT class became measured verdicts in seconds: `G(a->Xa)` ~2k DAG nodes
  unfolding to **5.1×10¹¹** tree nodes (sharing ~2.5×10⁸); `(a U b)|Gc` saturates the counter at
  2⁶⁰. Audit CLEAN.

- **Native-operator basis: investigated and CLOSED (2026-06-12, `probe_native_ops`).** Spot's
  constructors do NOT rewrite sugar (`U(1,a)` and `¬(a U b)` stay raw nodes), but the per-node
  simplifier normalizes every node to NNF even in basics-only mode; since the operators build
  bottom-up through `_simp_f`, **outputs are already in the native G/F/R/W basis** — census of
  real outputs shows `Not` only over atomic propositions. The surviving U nodes are GENUINE
  strong eventualities (distinct `¬β U τ` base cases): 94 in `G(a->Xb)`, 246 in `G(p->(qUr))` —
  the >32-acc-set driver is the genuine eventuality count, which no operator-basis change can
  reduce. Reduction must come from folding or non-translation verification. Baselines:
  `kr/testing/logs/baseline_*_2026-06-12.txt`.

- **Object-path translation is a dead end (2026-06-12, `probe_object_translate.py`).** Spot
  accepts our formula objects natively (`ltl_to_tgba_fm`, `translate`, `translator` class — no
  string round-trip), but Couvreur allocates one acceptance set per DISTINCT eventuality: our
  400–600 distinct temporal subterms blow the compile-time `mark_t` cap (32 in system Spot
  2.14.5) instantly, and `Ga|Gb` grinds >10s in the tableau before reaching the cap — the
  tableau's state space is sets of subformulas, which hash-consing does not shrink. Verification
  must come from word sampling / compositional grounding, or from folding the eventuality count
  below the cap.

## One-shot probe lifecycle (cleanup 2026-06-12)

A probe built to answer ONE question is committed, its finding recorded, then deleted — git
history keeps it. Removed in that sweep: `probe_object_translate`, `probe_native_ops`,
`probe_2l_rwith`, `probe_sbacc` (sbacc is baked into the pipeline), `test_kr_arch_adopt`,
`test_kr_muller` (settled in `config_graph`), `diag_stability` (per-case subprocess isolation
is now standard). Dead code swept the same day: unused `_F`/`_G` sugar builders (outputs get
native F/G via `_simp_f` NNF), and the never-read legacy 7-tuple `_reach_memo` write in
`reach_strong` (`_reach_memo` itself stays — `fin.py` caches through it).

## sl_driven full-suffix delegation — invariant-strip soundness fix (2026-06-15)

Kinská counting cases 06/07/09/10 reconstructed to unsound under-approximations
(06: L = (a.!a)*.a^w came out as bare `a`). Root cause: `reconstruct_ltl` strips
each state's downstream invariant off the automaton
(`_apply_downstream_invariants`), sound only because the linear walk re-adds it,
timed (X-wrapped), as it ENTERS the owning state. Full-suffix delegation skips
that walk; when the init state is itself in a multi-state SCC, `label(init)`
delegates the whole automaton up front, so a stripped INTERIOR invariant (a
terminal sink's `G a`) is never re-added and the delegate translates a widened
language. Not a loop-back/prefix issue (the sink is terminal) and not fixable by
a single end-AND (the invariant is interior, not global to the suffix, so it has
a temporal moment lost in the opaque fragment). Fix: keep `pristine_aut`
(pre-strip) and root `_sub_automaton_from` on it — numbering is preserved, the
delegate sees the invariant intact. 06/07 -> sound UNVERIFIED_SIZE; 09/10 ->
correctly NOT_LTL (the bogus `a` had masked the aperiodicity gate). Full kinska
sweep FALSE 4 -> 0. Tools kept: tests/sl/trace_sl_driven.py,
tests/sl/init_scc_report.py, tests/kr/diff_hoa.py, tests/kinska_breakdown.py.

Harness, same day: tests/survey.py enforces the per-case budget via
`timeout --signal=INT --kill-after=1` so a runaway GAP is reaped (no orphan), and
reports external wall time as build_s for every outcome. tests/kinska_sweep.sh
sweeps the corpus at a strict 15s/run (prunes its own logs/ from discovery).

## 2026-06-15 — simplify rule 4: boolean left-arm cofactoring (DONE)

New rule in `aut2ltl/ltl/simplify` (fold_pass `_arm_cofactor`, helper
`now_eval.prop_cofactor`): for a binary temporal with both arms purely
propositional, the left arm matters only on the positions where the right
arm has not yet fired, so restrict it to that care-set —
`φ U ψ → φ' U ψ` with φ' agreeing with φ on `{ψ false}` (W same);
`φ R ψ → φ' R ψ` agreeing on `{ψ true}` (M same, via `φ R ψ ≡ ¬(¬φ U ¬ψ)`).
φ' = Coudert–Madre restrict (`buddy.bdd_simplify(f, care)` — empirically
arg order is (f, care), NOT the manual's (d, f)) round-tripped through
BDD→ISOP, accepted only when strictly smaller. No temporal node
added/removed (Couvreur census untouched); wired after `_arm_unpad` in the
fold walk.

Motivating real case (polish/kinska sweep, 8ap-ba/randltl-10-a-hoa-5.txt,
source `h M e`): reference emitted `(e & !h) U (e & h)`; the rule reduces it
to `e U (e & h)`, which Spot prettifies back to `h M e`.

Tests: new `tests/kr/simplify/test_arm_cofactor.py` (10 shape+equiv cases,
SUCCESS); fold/now/factor/context suites CLEAN; `test_random_equiv.py`
500-formula fuzz ALL EQUIVALENT (28% changed); `test_kr_r4_audit.py` CLEAN;
`tests/survey.py` SUCCESS 35/35.

## 2026-06-16 — simplify rule 4: W/M expansion fold (DONE)

New independent fold in `fold_pass` (`_find_fold_or` / `_find_fold_and`,
commented there as logically separate from the X-unrolling folds): the
weak-until / strong-release laws `f W g ≡ Gf ∨ (f U g)` and
`f M g ≡ Ff ∧ (f R g)`, accepting the construction's ¬g-strengthened modal
body —
    G f         ∨ (f U g)   → f W g
    G(f ∧ ¬g)   ∨ (f U g)   → f W g      (sound: G(f∧¬g)∨(fUg) ≡ Gf∨(fUg))
and the duals to `f M g`. Body must be exactly f or f + a single ¬g
conjunct/disjunct; any other extra term makes G(body)/F(body) strictly
stronger/weaker (unsound, guarded + regression-tested). Trades two temporals
(G,U) for one (W) — an acc-set census win.

Chosen over a standalone pass (discussed): it IS a subcase of W-folding, and
inlining lets it compose with `_arm_cofactor` in the SAME bottom-up walk
(the U arm is cofactored before its parent Or is folded). So
`G(!b & h) | ((!b & h) U b)` → (cofactor) `G(!b & h) | (h U b)` →
(W-fold) `h W b`, recovering the source — the W/R analogue of the M-case
the cofactor rule already recovered.

Tests: new `tests/kr/simplify/test_wm_fold.py` (10 cases incl. 2 must-not-fire
guards, SUCCESS); fold/now/factor/context/arm_cofactor suites CLEAN;
`test_random_equiv` 500-formula fuzz ALL EQUIVALENT; `test_kr_r4_audit` CLEAN;
`tests/survey.py` SUCCESS 35/35.

## 2026-06-16 — simplify rule 4: GF/FG sibling cofactoring (DONE)

New independent rule in `fold_pass` (`_gffg_cofactor`, applied to boolean
nodes in the fold walk after `_fold_node`): under the cofinite invariant
`FG ψ`, the tail-only `GF φ` argument matters only where ψ holds —

    GF φ ∧ FG ψ   →   GF(φ|ψ)  ∧ FG ψ        φ restricted to {ψ true}
    FG α ∨ GF β   →   FG(α|¬β) ∨ GF β         dual (FG matters where β fails)

e.g. `GF(a&b) ∧ FG b → GF a ∧ FG b` (user's case). Care-set aggregates every
sibling invariant (`∧ ψ_k` for And; `¬(∨ β_k)` for Or), φ restricted via
`prop_cofactor` (Coudert–Madre + ISOP), accepted only when strictly smaller;
inner args must be propositional. No temporal node added/removed. Reuses the
`prop_cofactor` helper from the arm-cofactor rule.

Tests: new `tests/kr/simplify/test_gffg.py` (8 cases incl. Or-dual, nested,
2 must-not-fire guards — non-propositional arg + no-FG-sibling — SUCCESS);
all simplify suites CLEAN/SUCCESS; `test_random_equiv` fuzz ALL EQUIVALENT;
`test_kr_r4_audit` CLEAN; `tests/survey.py` SUCCESS 35/35.

## 2026-06-16 — wire own_simplify into the decompose recombiner (DONE)

The own-rules simplifier ran per kr-node and per leaf result, but
`portfolio/decompose._recombine` assembled the recombined And/Or and returned
it RAW — so a cross-part fold like `G(!b & h) | (h U b) → h W b` was never
attempted (no per-node pass ever saw that Or whole). Found via survey_diff:
the W/M + GF/FG rules unit-tested green but did NOT move the kinska sweep
output (`h W b` still emitted as `G(!b & h) | (h U b)`).

Fix: `_recombine` now runs `builders.own_simplify` (our rules ONLY — Spot's
tl_simplifier is deliberately excluded, it is not DAG-size aware) on each
part BEFORE combining and on the combo AFTER; the decompose recursion gives
both at every nesting level. Exposed a typed public `builders.own_simplify`
(wraps `_own_simp`: shared process bdd_dict, KR_SIMP_OWN size guard, no Spot).

Verified: `h W b`/`c W d` → source, `d R e` → d M e-fold, 8ap HOA → `h W b`.
survey.py SUCCESS (DAG 488→487); kr_r4_audit CLEAN; build_portfolio/
contract_combinators/options ALL OK/PASS.

## 2026-06-16 — LTL-definability gate moved off the sbacc form; Muller cap removed

- **Regression**: monolithic (non-`decompose`) cascade paths (`acc`/`weak`/
  `buchi`/`cobuchi`/`str`/`bls`) reported `NOT_LTL` for `GFa & GFb & GFc` — a
  formula written *in* LTL, so trivially LTL-definable. A false impossibility.
- **Root cause**: the gate (commit `fa900a2`) tested `IsAperiodicSemigroup` on
  the cascade's own `det_parity_sbacc()` automaton. Forcing STATE-BASED
  acceptance (`sbacc`) degeneralizes generalized-Büchi `Inf(0)&Inf(1)&Inf(2)`
  into a "which mark am I waiting for" counter — a real cyclic group in THAT
  automaton's transition monoid (GAP: 5 states, |T|=43, non-aperiodic), even
  though the language is LTL. Aperiodicity is a property of the SYNTACTIC monoid;
  the sbacc-inflated form is the wrong object. The same language in generic form
  is 1 state, |T|=1, aperiodic. The `conclusive = n <= sat_min_threshold` hedge
  was also unsound (small ≠ minimal, and `det_parity_sbacc` never SAT-minimizes).
- **Why `decompose` never misfired**: it splits the `&` into `GFa`/`GFb`/`GFc`
  *before* the gate, so no 3-way conjunct is ever degeneralized.
- **Fix** (gate on a sbacc-FREE form, before the build):
  - `language.py` — `Language` now HOLDS an `ltl_definable` `(definable,
    conclusive)` tag (`set_ltl_definable` / `ltl_definable`); it does not derive
    it (floor cannot import kr).
  - `kr/gap/aperiodic.py` (new) — `is_aperiodic_gens`: minimal GAP script
    (`Semigroup` + `IsAperiodicSemigroup`, NO holonomy), the cheap LTL oracle.
  - `kr/ltl_tester.py` (new) — `label_ltl_definable(lang)`: runs the oracle on
    `det_generic_minimal()` (deterministic, generic, SAT-min when small), caches
    the verdict on the Language. `conclusive` iff the form was state-minimal.
  - `kr/aut2cas.py` — the gate now runs `label_ltl_definable` BEFORE
    `decompose_lang` (skips the explosive holonomy build on non-LTL) and on the
    right form; the old post-build `casc.aperiodic` block + `_sat_min_threshold`
    are removed. One choke point for all cascade members (top + inner core share
    the single `as_translator`).
- **Muller cap removed** (`kr/cascade/config_graph.py`, `kr/options.py`): the
  good-Muller-set enumeration was capped by `KR_MULLER_SCC_LIMIT` (12), above
  which it emitted the whole-SCC set only — an APPROXIMATION that can build a
  non-equivalent formula. Removed entirely: enumeration is now always exact; if
  it explodes the run times out (honest), never approximates. The dead option is
  gone too.
- **Verification**: probes showed `GFa&GFb&GFc` 5-state/|T|=43/non-aperiodic
  (parity+sbacc) vs 1-state/|T|=1/aperiodic (generic); counting automata stay
  non-aperiodic on BOTH forms (no false negatives). R4 audit CLEAN. Survey sweep
  SUCCESS, 17/17 configs, zero `NOT_LTL` on the LTL corpus. Kinská sweep SUCCESS,
  strict improvement: 20 genuine `counting_buchi_*` cases that previously
  `BUILD_TIMEOUT` (build-first, then check) now report `NOT_LTL` quickly
  (cheap-check-first), 0 regressions. Reference baselines regenerated
  (`tests/logs/reference/20260616/`, kinská overwritten).

## 2026-06-16 — LTL simplify: completed the binary-modal expansion-fold quartet
The W/M expansion folds in `aut2ltl/ltl/simplify/fold_pass.py` covered only two
of the four laws (`f W g ≡ Gf ∨ (fUg)` at Or, `f M g ≡ Ff ∧ (fRg)` at And).
Added the two missing duals, both observed in real traces:
  - R-fold (Or):  `G(g ∧ ¬f) ∨ (f M g) → f R g`   (e.g. `G(!d & e) | (d M e) → d R e`)
  - U-fold (And): `F(g ∨ ¬f) ∧ (f W g) → f U g`
Both sound via the strengthened-body collapse (`G(g∧¬f)∨(fMg) ≡ Gg∨(fMg)`;
`F(g∨¬f)∧(fWg) ≡ Fg∧(fWg)`, the Gf branch of fWg killing g∨¬f). Each trades
two temporals for one (acc-set census win), same shape as the existing pair.
`tests/kr/simplify/test_wm_fold.py` extended (22 cases incl. must-not-fire for
the strictly-stronger/weaker extra-term variants); fuzz `test_random_equiv.py`
ALL EQUIVALENT, r4 audit CLEAN. README fold bullet rewritten to the 4-law quartet.
Other rules' duals confirmed accounted for (G/F absorption, GF/FG cofactor,
arm-cofactor U/W/R/M all present); the two deliberately-absent duals are the
S1/S2 W/M variants (unsound, regression-tested) and arm-padding's M case (sound
but never observed in outputs — arm-padding is empirically driven).

## 2026-06-17 — LANDED: result.py migration campaign complete; LTLFormulaResult retired

Completed the campaign tracked in TODO.md (steps 1–10). Every producer/combinator
now returns `aut2ltl/result.py::Result` (closed `Status` OK/DECLINED/NOT_LTL +
`credit`/`fuse`/`first` algebras per `result.md`); the legacy
`contract.py::LTLFormulaResult` dataclass, the `OK`/`DECLINED`/`NOT_LTL`/
`PROBABLY_NOT_LTL` status-string constants, the `_LEGACY_UNSUPPORTED` sentinel,
and `.conclusive`/`.note`/`not_ltl_definable` are all GONE.

- `contract.py` keeps only the `Translator`/`CascadeTranslator` Protocols, now
  annotated `-> Result`.
- `decompose.py::_recombine` reworked to the strict accumulator idiom
  (`fuse(start, *subs)` → bail-if-nok → fill formula), so a NOK fused with a NOK
  inherits BOTH diagnoses (the defect the user flagged: constructor-at-return
  dropped sibling reasons). `credit`/`fail` accumulate diagnoses via `_add_diagnosis`.
- `__main__.py` non-definability branch collapsed to a single `NOT_LTL` label
  (exit 3) printing `res.diagnosis`; decline test is now `not res.ok`.
- `PROBABLY_NOT_LTL` collapsed into `NOT_LTL` (proof-vs-hint wording lives in the
  diagnosis text). The Language-level `(definable, conclusive)` verdict in
  `language.py`/`ltl_tester.py` is a SEPARATE mechanism and stays; `aut2cas.py`
  folds its conclusive/hint qualifier into the `Result.not_definable(diagnosis=)`.
- Removed `Result`'s retro-compat harness (the `getattr(other, "note", ...)`
  duck-typing fallback in `credit`) now that no legacy result exists.
- Retired stale test scaffolding referencing the dead type: `tests/sl/probe_sl_core.py`,
  `tests/sl/probe_sl_over_str.py`, `tests/test_contract_combinators.py`,
  `tests/kr/test_acc_translator.py` (git rm; revisit only if needed).

Gates: `tests/kr/test_kr_r4_audit.py` CLEAN; `tests/survey.py` SUCCESS (35/35
validated, 0 false, 0 declined, DAG=487 temporals=119 build=8.8s).

## 2026-06-17 — daisy: pure self-loop core extracted as a peer translator

Lifted the pure marguerite/daisy core out of `aut2ltl/sl/sl_core.py` (`SlCore`) into
a new sibling package `aut2ltl/daisy/`, peer to `partscc`/`sccdecomp`: `daisy.py`
(the `Daisy(child)` combinator — peel one daisy = STAY∞ ∨ LEAVE, delegate stems to
the child), `shape.py` (the structure helpers `is_daisy`/`split`/`reroot`),
`algorithm.md` (clean spec, lifted from the "Algorithm presentation" half of
`sl/algorithm.md`), `__init__.py` (context-free, contract-only — names no siblings).
Naming converged through `slpeel` → **daisy** (memorable structural metaphor over a
descriptive compound; sets up the "daisy chains" big-self-loop extension); technique
tag is now `daisy`. Removed `sl/sl_core.py`; repointed the four probes (`probe_sl_core`,
`probe_sl_over_str`, `probe_inv`, `probe_sccdecomp`) to `aut2ltl.daisy.Daisy`. Still
unwired (probe-only, as `sl_core` was) — no STATUS shift. Verified via the probes
(`a U b`, `inv` over it, `sccdecomp` over it): all equiv=True, tag `daisy`.

## 2026-06-17 — decomp/: regroup the (de)composition approaches, themed by folder

Created aut2ltl/decomp/ as a theme folder, one self-contained subpackage per way of
breaking a language into easier pieces (each with its own algorithm.md, its own
inline recombine — nothing shared by force; decomp/__init__ imports none of them, so
one approach drags in neither its siblings nor their deps):

- decomp/scc/        — moved from aut2ltl/sccdecomp/ (SccDecompose; tag scc<k>).
- decomp/strength/   — NEW StrengthDecompose: ∨ over weak/terminal/strong (Renault
                       TACAS'13, exact for any automaton; tag strength<k>).
- decomp/acceptance/ — NEW AccDecompose: ∧ over acceptance conjuncts, exact on the
                       deterministic generic-minimal form (tag acc<k>).
- decomp/inv/        — moved from aut2ltl/inv/ (Invariant decorator); its doc
                       README.md → algorithm.md for folder parity.

strength + acceptance are the two halves of portfolio/decompose.py's AND/OR split,
re-cast as separate pure peer Translators (portfolio/decompose.py itself untouched —
still unwired). Verified via per-approach probes: Ga|Gb (scc3), Fa|Gb (strength2),
GFa&GFb (acc2), aUb (inv), all equiv=True. CLAUDE.md project-layout line updated.


## (archived) aut2ltl/kr/TODO.md — folded into history 2026-06-17

The kr TODO had become mostly a done-list; archived verbatim here and git rm-ed.

# kr/ TODO

Forward-looking work items only. Current state: `kr/STATUS.md`. History: `git log`.
Construction reference: `paper/automata-to-ltl-construction.md`; ground truth:
`paper/Automata2LTL.txt` (Sec 4.2 + Table 1 + Formulas 3/4/5 ≈ lines 440–1040).

Context for prioritization: the FoSSaCS construction is implemented and
semantically validated (see STATUS). The thesis we are now chasing is that the
paper's double-exponential is a *flat-rendering* artifact: every case measured
so far builds a small hash-consed DAG in fractions of a second while only the
unfolded tree/string explodes. P0 below is the work that turns that
observation into a usable pipeline (and a SOTA claim).

## P0 — practice beats the bound (active)

Analysis, measurements and OPEN questions behind these items live in
`kr/dag_folding.md` (item numbering there: plumbing → vacuity pruning →
fold pass → interning). Items below are the actionable queue.

0. ~~**buchi2ltl on hash-consed `spot.formula` DAGs**~~ **DONE 2026-06-14.**
   buchi2ltl is now DAG-native end to end: `reconstruct_ltl` builds a hash-consed
   `spot.formula` DAG (t2 fragments included — `terminal_2scc` emits formula DAGs),
   and an adopted `scc_labeler` formula is spliced as a child node WITHOUT
   flattening. `sl_driven` drives it and its labeler returns the kr `spot.formula`
   DAG directly (no `str()`), so the kr-under-sl delegation boundary no longer
   flattens: `probe_sl_compose` all equiv=True, high-sharing cores stay tiny while
   kr-on-the-whole explodes — `XX(G(a->Fb))` 21 nodes vs 1.2×10¹⁴-tree,
   `c U (G(a->Fb))` 28 nodes vs TIMEOUT. Built as a temporary parallel module first
   and cross-oracled against the old string engine (MP ladder + randltl, 0
   divergences); the size census on the default decompose path is byte-identical to
   the pre-flush baseline (pure engineering refactor). The string engine and the
   cross-oracle (`reconstruction_dag.py`, `probe_dag_oracle.py`) were then DELETED;
   the engine was folded into `reconstruction.py` with the shared automaton helpers
   split into `reconstruction_helpers.py`. Gates green (r4 audit CLEAN, survey 70
   equiv=True / 0 fail). **Spin-off (agreed, next):** return a result struct with
   `.formula` + a `.technique` set (accumulating gate/and/or/buchi/cobuchi/bls/…)
   instead of a bare formula, and wire it into the surveys (see
   `[[technique-report-struct]]`).

1. **Fold pass — step A DONE 2026-06-12** (per-DAG-node memoized
   tl_simplifier, hybrid full≤2000-nodes/basics policy + reach dead-tail
   early-out): `G(p->(qUr))` distinct temporal 4115→559, `G(a->Xb)` tree
   85.5M→3.6M, `a&Xa` subproblems 752→311. Remaining candidates, in the
   order the tail-anatomy data suggests (probe_tail_anatomy.py: TAILS drive
   the explosion — ×2–10 distinct tails per level — not the avoid web):
   - ~~**B. letter fusion**~~ **DONE 2026-06-12** (soundness:
     dag_folding.md "Letter fusion"; numbers: STATUS — XXa/XXXa collapse
     to the literal formulas, 3 survey cases flip True, G(a->Xb) under
     the acc cap). Remaining wall is fusion-neutral cases (1 AP, all
     letters distinct futures): `X(a&Xa)` 3.1×10¹⁰, `G(a->Xa)` 11.3M —
     they need C/D/E below or the 1c rewrite pass.
   - ~~**F. per-conjunct Fin-reachability fold**~~ **DONE 2026-06-13**
     (`config_graph.configs_reachable_from`, used in the Muller-DNF assembly,
     default on, `KR_FOLD_FIN_REACH=0` restores). For a good Muller set M keep
     `Fin(C∉M)` only for C reachable from M in the config graph (drop the rest):
     `¬Fin(C∈M)` forces Inf⊇M, Inf is strongly connected, so C∈Inf ⟹ C∈reach(M)
     — C off the cone is implied finite. Pure graph check, no containment.
     **Subsumes the absorbing-M special case** (M absorbing ⟺ reach(M)=M) and,
     unlike it, (i) prunes Fin(C) on non-bottom M and (ii) decides the kept set
     BEFORE building `fin_c` (the explosive part) so dropped configs cost zero.
     **Bites the distinct-temporal census, not just the tree**: no-fold→on
     (absorbing-only in parens) — `a U b` 87→13 tree, 4→1 temporals (literal
     formula); `F(a&Xb)` 4251→2739 / **74→64** (abs 74, no change); `(aUb)|Gc`
     637→525 / 22→18; `Ga|Gb` 7026→6438 / 47→46; `Fa&Gb` 187→159 / 12→11;
     `G(a->Xa)` →141; `X(a&Xa)` →4134. Audit CLEAN, survey 0 fail / no
     regressions. Still over the 32-acc cap where they were (`F(a&Xb)` 64) —
     the kept `¬Fin(M)`/reachable-`Fin` part dominates (census-anatomy);
     deeper census reduction is the open P1 acceptance-dispatch job.
   - **C. cascade-aware vacuity pruning** of the combined-letter enumeration
     (unreachable pre-configs, empty Enter/Stay) — prunes memo keys at the
     b^k base; soundness argument needed (see dag_folding.md OPEN).
   - **D. tail normalization** (canonical letter-word prefix + continuation
     form) — syntactic, internal, targets the wrapping count directly;
     expected partially subsumed by B (fewer distinct tails by construction).
   - **E. budgeted semantic interning** of small subterms.
1c. **Own syntactic rewrite pass — IN PROGRESS (kr/simplify/, 2026-06-12).**
   Rule 1 (context pass: sibling-context propagation over the boolean
   skeleton, identity domination incl. temporal nodes, Shannon at Or,
   context reset at temporal boundaries) DONE + validated
   (kr/simplify/testing/test_context_pass.py, 16/16 with per-case Spot
   equivalence). Rule 2 (now-evaluation: one-step unroll of G/F/U/R/W/M
   heads under boolean context, shrink-only, identity + BDD entailment)
   DONE + validated (test_now_eval.py, 18/18). Rule 3 (partial factoring,
   the sound form + Minato minimization of guard groups) DONE + validated
   (test_factor_pass.py, 10/10 incl. the draft-bug regression).
   ~~Pipeline integration~~ **DONE 2026-06-12** (KR_SIMP_OWN per-node hook
   in _simp_f, persistent memos, size cap 2000, shared bdd_dict; numbers
   in STATUS — gates green, fuzz 1500 ALL EQUIVALENT).
   ~~Rule 4: unroll-inverse folding~~ **DONE 2026-06-12** (fold_pass.py —
   expansion-law pair folds + first-occurrence/induction + S1/S2
   Formula-5 subsumption; the census-reducing realization of the
   "eventuality-aware rewriting" item: F(a&Xa) census 55→33, G(a->Xb)
   flipped survey True; numbers in STATUS). Refinement queue:
   ~~Context-aware subsumption~~ **DONE 2026-06-13** (initial-state
   opening + ctx_subsume; F(a&Xa) UNDER the 32-acc cap, census 26;
   numbers in STATUS). Remaining:
   - **eventuality census, remaining**: F(a&Xb) still 74 distinct
     temporals (cap 32). Next: deeper-shifted ladder forms (only the
     one-step shift is matched), and the multi-AP variants.
   - **opening flow direction**: one-way (earlier→later in canonical
     child order) misses openings whose source sorts after the target;
     alternating the direction across the pipeline's repeated context
     passes is sound (each pass a fixed direction) and would double
     coverage — needs the direction in the context-pass memo key.
   - giant nodes are skipped by the cap, so the X(a&Xa)/reactivity wall
     is barely moved — needs either O(n) factoring on big Ors or the
     C/D/E fold candidates. NB the cap measures UNFOLDED tree size; with
     per-node memoized passes a DAG-size cap is the honest poly bound
     and would let the top of big formulas be processed.
   - fold pass changes memo keys → construction takes different paths
     (X(a&Xa) unfolded count moved both ways across tools); re-baseline
     the size censuses in kr/testing/logs/.
   - the 32-acc abort path in equiv children dies with free(): invalid
     pointer (teardown, cosmetic but masks the real verdict — make the
     harness report it as ACC_CAP). Background
   (user rule set, Java lineage): Spot's
   tl_simplifier, even at full strength on 5-node inputs, does NOT do
   present-literal cofactoring or guard factoring: `a & (!a | G(!a|Xa))`
   (≡ Ga) and `(!a & Xa) | (a & Xa)` (≡ Xa) both survive full simplify
   untouched (probe_guard_fusion part A). Candidate rules, sharing-aware
   per DAG node (the "grow our own rule set" hatch in ltl_builders):
   (i) cofactoring `a ∧ (¬a ∨ φ) → a ∧ φ`; (ii) Or-factoring
   `(g₁∧Xt) ∨ (g₂∧Xt) → (g₁∨g₂)∧Xt` + Minato guard minimize (catches
   tails that become equal only after simplification, which construction-
   time fusion cannot see); (iii) induction `x ∧ G(x→Xx) ≡ Gx` (riskier,
   parked separately).
2. ~~**Output representation**~~ **DONE 2026-06-12**: reconstruct returns the
   hash-consed `spot.formula` DAG; flattening is opt-in (`reconstruct_ltl_str`
   historical entry, `_str_f_gated` under `KR_FLATTEN_TREE_LIMIT`). The former
   CONSTRUCT_TIMEOUT cases now report measured sizes in seconds (`G(a->Xa)`:
   5.1×10¹¹ tree nodes from ~2k DAG nodes). This is the native input for the
   planned BDD-style analysis layer.
3. **Verification beyond Spot translation — now the verification front**:
   compositional checking (trace_fin is the per-sub-term oracle),
   word-sampling validator (ultimately-periodic u·v^ω, construction-ref
   pitfall #10), equivalence-based interning of subterms. Probed and CLOSED
   (2026-06-12, `probe_object_translate.py`): translating from the formula
   OBJECT (Couvreur fm / translator class) does not dodge the wall — one acc
   set per distinct eventuality (cap 32 compile-time) and the tableau state
   space is subformula SETS, which sharing doesn't shrink. So: either fold
   the distinct-eventuality count below 32 (item 1 + interning), or verify
   without translation. Spot authors are in the loop on sharing-aware
   translation; revisit when they ship anything.

## P1 — coverage

- **Acceptance dispatch per construction-ref §9.3 — IN PROGRESS, THE ACTIVE
  FRONT (orthogonal module `kr/acceptance_dispatch.py`). Resume here.**
  The Muller DNF (`Δ₂`, the default) is the explosive form; Theorem 2 gives a
  direct φ per acceptance class that drops the Fin web. Dispatch table (det
  class → frag → φ): looping-coBüchi/`Σ₁`/`⋁reach_to(ι,C)`;
  looping-Büchi/`Π₁`/`⋀¬reach_to(ι,C)`; weak/`Δ₁`/`⋁_G end_in(G)`;
  coBüchi/`Σ₂`/`⋀_{C∈α}Fin(C)`; Büchi/`Π₂`/`⋁_{C∈α}¬Fin(C)`; Muller/`Δ₂`/full
  DNF. The looping/weak forms use `reach_to` (NO Fin); Büchi/coBüchi keep ONE
  Fin per accepting config (no `Fin(C∉G)` web, no good-set enumeration).
  - ~~**Büchi (`Π₂`)**~~ **WIRED on the default path — 2026-06-13.**
    `reconstruct_buchi(casc)` = `⋁_{C∈α}¬Fin(C)`, returns None if not
    `acc().is_buchi()`. Hooked as a TOP-LEVEL pre-check at the head of
    `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style` (gate `KR_DISPATCH_BUCHI`, default ON; `=0`
    restores pure Muller) — NOT in `reconstruct_bls`, because the GOTO decompose
    front end calls `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style` directly per piece, so the
    single pre-check covers both entries and fires per single-condition piece.
    α is COVER-AWARE (`config_graph.buchi_accepting_configs` off
    `build_pruned_config_aut`, not the lift-section `accepting_configs()`):
    the wiring exposed the cover caveat below — `F(a&Xb)` first went equiv=FALSE
    (`L⊊L(orig)`, lift α missed the duplicated accepting sink) and the cover
    reader fixed it. Gates: audit CLEAN, survey 0/35 FALSE / four walls flipped
    True / zero regressions, size A/B `G(p->(qUr))` 84→14 temporals (totals −22%,
    tractable-cases −61%); numbers + logs in STATUS. ~~Cover caveat~~ RESOLVED.
  - ~~**coBüchi (`Σ₂`)**~~ **WIRED — 2026-06-13.** `reconstruct_cobuchi(casc)` =
    `⋀_{C∈α}Fin(C)` (α = `config_graph.cobuchi_finite_configs`, the cover-aware
    DUAL of the Büchi reader), as a SECOND pre-check after Büchi in
    `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style` (gate `KR_DISPATCH_COBUCHI`, default ON). **GATE
    is the crux:** Spot's parity step hides coBüchi as `Inf(0)|Fin(1)`
    (`is_co_buchi()` False), so the gate recovers the natural acceptance via
    `postprocess(.,"generic")` and tests `is_co_buchi` there — and this MUST be
    measured UNDER decomposition (the raw `decompose_aut` view both misleads on
    the gate and overstates size: sat_minimize ~halves `FGa|FGb`). The
    `postprocess(.,"coBuchi")` gate is UNSOUND (GFa passes it). Results: `FGa`
    6→3 / `F(a&Gb)` 7→4 / **`FGa|FGb` 6195→2779 temporals** (still over the cap,
    UNVERIFIED — the residual is reach-driven) / reactivity `(GFa&FGb)` 10→7
    (its persistence AND-piece dispatches); totals −40%. Survey 0/35 FALSE, only
    `FGa|FGb`'s UNVERIFIED size changed; audit CLEAN. Numbers + logs in STATUS.
  - ~~**looping/weak (Δ₁/Σ₁/Π₁)**~~ **WIRED but OFF by default — 2026-06-13
    (`KR_DISPATCH_WEAK`).** `reconstruct_weak` = `⋁_G end_in(G)` (pure `reach_to`,
    no Fin; subsumes looping safety `⋀¬reach_to(sink)` / guarantee
    `⋁reach_to(sink)`), gate `is_weak_automaton(postprocess(.,"generic"))`, placed
    BEFORE Büchi/coBüchi (which else claim weak langs first). Correct (flag-on
    survey 0/35 FALSE) but a SIZE REGRESSION, so kept OFF: probes
    (`probe_weak_dispatch`, `probe_looping_dispatch`) show general worse 6/7,
    dedicated looping mixed (2 wins / 3 losses). The residual on weak cases is
    REACH-driven (τ-tail), which no acceptance form touches — looping just swaps
    the Fin-web for `reach_to` at the same cascade depth. Kept in as the A/B
    baseline for the Acc(c) idea below.
- ~~**config-indexed `Acc(c)` for the weak/bounded class**~~ **DONE — WIRED,
  default ON (2026-06-13, `KR_DISPATCH_ACC`).** `reconstruct_acc` = `Acc(ι)` by
  bounded unroll (R1 ⊤/⊥ Spot oracle on the small input D + R2 one-step unroll),
  SELF-GATING (declines → BLS on any recurrent config), first in the dispatch
  chain. **Cracks `X(a&Xa)`: UNVERIFIED 5.1×10⁸ → equiv=True, literal output**;
  whole X-ladder collapses to the literal; recurrent cases decline. Survey: only
  `X(a&Xa)` changed (UNVERIFIED→True), 0/35 FALSE, zero regressions; audit CLEAN.
  Numbers + logs in STATUS. Remaining items spun off:
  - **Replace the Spot ⊤/⊥ oracle with a structural test.** R1 currently uses
    `is_empty`/`are_equivalent` on D-from-q (bounded, small input, but a Spot call
    in the construction path — the one departure from "Spot for hash-consing
    only"). A graph test — q ⊥ iff no accepting state reachable from q; q ⊤ iff no
    rejecting behaviour reachable (on the deterministic complete D) — would keep
    the construction Spot-free. Soundness-check before swapping.
  - **Per-config (not whole) fallback at recurrent configs.** Acc currently bails
    the WHOLE construction to BLS on the first recurrent config (clean for the pure
    bounded fragment). A transient-prefix + recurrent-core input would benefit from
    splicing BLS/dispatch only at the recurrent configs (`Acc(c) = BLS-from-c`
    there), extending Acc past the pure-bounded class. Mind the cover/state-vs-config
    map when splicing (cf. the Büchi cover caveat).
- ~~**Last MP-survey wall: `FGa|FGb`**~~ **CRACKED by the buchi2ltl gate
  (2026-06-14): 2779→3 temporals, equiv=True; MP survey now a clean sweep.** The
  persistence-union the cascade/decompose path could not split is handled
  directly by buchi2ltl's backward labeling on the raw (nondeterministic) form.
  See STATUS "buchi2ltl heuristic gate". Spin-off items below.
- **buchi2ltl gate — wired, default ON (2026-06-14, `kr/heuristic_gate.py` +
  `decompose_recombine`). Landed; refinements:**
  - **Spot ⊤/⊥-style dependence is now just the bounded TGBA `postprocess` in
    the gate** (language-preserving, on the small node) — acceptable like Acc(c).
    No per-call equiv check (sound-by-construction, audited 0/0 over ~170 randltl
    via `fuzz_gate_decompose.py`); `KR_GATE_VERIFY` keeps the audit one env away.
  - ~~**gate-vs-split order**~~ **gate goes UNDER decomposition now
    (2026-06-14, `KR_GATE_UNDER_DECOMP`, default ON).** Decompose FIRST, gate the
    leaves; raw-form gate only when the root does not split (the
    determinization-sensitive cases — measured in `probe_gate_redet.py`). This
    fixed the honesty bug the size census exposed: a case `split_report` called
    `or(2)` used to be taken whole by the gate (`tech=sl`), now it actually
    decomposes (`tech=or+sl`). Size A/B (`survey_sizes_underdecomp` vs
    `survey_sizes_method`): wash (DAG 494→491, temporal 114→119) — OR-unions
    tighter (`Fa|Gb` tree 13→8), AND-conjunctions un-factored (`GFa&GFb` vs
    gate-whole `G(Fa&Fb)`, +1 temporal), all under cap & stylistically equal.
    Parked: per-node pick-smaller (build gate-whole AND decomposed, keep fewer
    temporals) would recover the AND factoring; not worth it at these magnitudes.
  - **technique reporting (`ReconResult`) — DONE 2026-06-14.** `reconstruct_decomposed`
    and buchi2ltl's `reconstruct_ltl` return `kr.recon_result.ReconResult`
    (`.formula` + `.technique` set), wired into both surveys' `tech=` column.
    Cross-package import edge (buchi2ltl→kr) deferred to a shared `util` —
    `[[technique-report-struct]]`.
  - **adopt rate ~81%** on random formulas; the ~19% it declines (and the
    UNVERIFIED giants) are exactly the REACH/cascade cases kr carries — the two
    paths are complementary, gate for shape-friendly + decomposition, kr for the
    systematic fallback.
- **Decompose-and-recombine at the root — LANDED + now the goto path
  (2026-06-13, `kr/decompose_recombine.py`; numbers in STATUS).** Both splits
  implemented and validated; `reconstruct_decomposed(aut)` is the survey default
  (`KR_DECOMPOSE=1`). Sound because kr is language-faithful and a ROOT operator
  is a pure position-0 language op: `L(A)=⋃L(Aᵢ) ⟹ ⋁ kr(Aᵢ)` / `⋂ ⟹ ⋀`.
  - ~~**OR-decompose by STRENGTH**~~ DONE (`decompose_scc` w/t/s, union =
    language; Renault TACAS'13): `Ga|Fb` 499→21 tree (True), `(aUb)|Gc`
    6.97M→637 (True flipped from UNVERIFIED).
  - ~~**AND-decompose by ACCEPTANCE SET**~~ DONE (`top_conjuncts()` on the det
    acceptance; determinism makes `acc=⋀cᵢ ⟹ L=⋂L(A|cᵢ)` exact): `GFa&GFb`
    9.08e16→111 (True flipped), `(GFa&FGb)` 2⁶⁰→True, `GFa&GFb&GFc` unbuildable
    →compositional SOUND, `G(a->Fb)&G(c->Fd)` True at L=7.
  - Open-checks resolved: (1) the conjunctive form is `translate/postprocess`
    deterministic-GENERIC (not parity); split BEFORE parity normalization.
    (2) per-piece census is small (each single-Büchi piece ~10 temporals).
    (3) front-end wrapper `_to_split_form`→dispatch→`⋀`/`⋁`. NEW finding: kr's
    census is acutely state-count-sensitive, so `_to_split_form` must
    `sat_minimize` the det automaton (AUTOMATON-only — `GFa&FGb` 2-state
    postprocess explodes to 9.5e15, 1-state sat_minimize → 313).
  Remaining work:
  - ~~**export from `kr/__init__.py`**~~ DONE — `reconstruct_decomposed` /
    `split_report` exported; README documents `reconstruct_decomposed(aut)` as
    the recommended top-level entry (automaton in, formula DAG out).
  - **acceptance ABSORPTION** blocks both splits when Spot's determinization
    folds a second component into one set/strength: `GFa&Gb` (recurrence ∧
    safety → single `Inf(0)`, `none`, stays 89 temporals over cap) and
    `FGa|FGb` (persistence union → single co-Büchi, `none`, 2⁶⁰). Need a way
    to expose the absorbed component as a separate conjunct/strength, or a
    different split basis for these.
  - **n≥3 verification**: the recombined `⋀` trips Spot's 32-acc cap; the
    compositional check (`kr(pieceᵢ)≡L(pieceᵢ)`) is the sound witness — wire it
    into the survey as the verdict for over-cap recombinations (currently only
    in `probe_and_decompose`).
  Lineage: same root-soundness that makes `φ ∧ kr` sound when the INITIAL state
  carries an arbitrary φ; decomposition is that applied to ⋃/⋂.
- π-preimage exactness in the non-primary paths: `accepting_configs` and the
  config_graph fallbacks still map states through the lift only (the primary
  pruned-config-aut path is already correct via `state_of` = π). With covers
  real (duplicated sinks), the fallbacks should classify every closure config
  through π.
- Trivial (size-1) level collapse to reduce effective depth.

## P2 — feasibility

- Larger |AP| (on-demand letters or BDD guards instead of explicit 2^k —
  8 letters already multiply the combined-letter fan-out visibly).
- Hierarchy class tagging of outputs (Σᵢ/Πᵢ/Δᵢ per Lemma 5).

## P3 — testing & docs

- Extend semantic grounding from fin_c sub-terms to arbitrary reach calls
  (GT automaton for "reach T from S avoiding B" with β/τ obligations).
- More multi-level round-trips + size/depth metrics vs paper bounds (the
  DAG-vs-tree table in STATUS is the seed of the empirical argument).
- Finite-word variant (weak next in wsolid, construction-ref §10) — stretch.
- **NOT_LTL detection — IN PROGRESS (2026-06-15).** Non-LTL inputs (kinská
  `counting/`) currently get a WRONG formula from the cascade leaves (the
  holonomy group component is mislabeled `KIND reset`); SL correctly declines.
  Oracle: `IsAperiodicSemigroup(T)` on D's transition monoid (LTL ⟺ counter-free
  ⟺ aperiodic). Contract `NOT_LTL` / `PROBABLY_NOT_LTL` landed; wire GAP emit →
  parse → cascade flag → leaf members → portfolio/`__main__`. Conclusive only
  when D is state-minimal (`PROBABLY_NOT_LTL` above the SAT-min threshold).

## P4 — heuristic/kr mixin via suffix-formula injection (LOW PRIO, deferred)

Revisit only once the main census-wall path (P0 folds + P1 acceptance
dispatch) is stable. The idea: hand a hard component to a heuristic that
returns a formula φ_q labeling a state q of the original aut, then splice φ_q
into the kr reconstruction at the precise time points where the construction
"enters" q (config c with `state_of(c)=π(c)=q`; the config↔state map is the
traceability bridge — `state_of`/`state_to_config` already exist). Cleanest
realization: STUB q to terminal-accepting (its sub-automaton reduces to True,
the cascade handles the trivial residual) and conjoin φ_q once at the
`reach_strong(c,…)` arrival, UNDER the arriving X.

Conclusions from the 2026-06-13 exploration (what kinds of φ / side effects
work, and why — keep these; the exploratory code was reverted):

- The augmented language is `L(A) ∩ L(G(at_q → φ))`, `at_q` a deterministic
  state predicate. Always ω-regular; the question is whether kr can inject φ
  WITHOUT paying an exponential.
- kr has NO localized "language-from-q" subterm Ψ_q — it characterises
  acceptance globally (Muller DNF over i.o. config sets + reach/Fin). So
  "AND φ on top of what kr asserts at q" is well-defined as a LOCAL edit only
  where q's contribution collapses to one point: a terminal stub (Ψ_q=True)
  or a single transient (Fin) arrival. (Contrast: compositional
  state-elimination / the buchi2ltl backward labeling DO have L(q), so their
  `scc_fragments` splice is trivial — `buchi2ltl/reconstruction.py`.)
- SOUND + cheap to inject locally  ⟺  φ is ACCEPTANCE-NEUTRAL at q:
  * safety/invariant φ (small deterministic monitor; the extreme case is
    G(inv), a 1-state monitor) — does not perturb the Muller condition; only
    the loop encoding must be un-fused to expose the per-visit hook
    `G(at_q_letter → φ ∧ …)` (a size cost, NO exponential);
  * terminal stub — q stops participating in acceptance, so φ is asserted
    once at the single arrival.
- NOT a free lunch for LIVENESS φ at a RECURRENT q: the correct meaning
  `G(at_q → φ)` changes the acceptance question, forcing the product A×B_φ and
  re-derivation of the Muller condition. The exponential reappears in the
  product's recurrent structure — kr pays for acceptance, and renaming the
  liveness as "a formula on q" does not move it out of the Muller machinery.

Concrete from the attempt (reverted, recorded here): per-state downstream
invariants are computable by live-edge constancy on the aut (skip sinks =
states not co-reachable to an accepting SCC), validated against a semantic
oracle (`L` restarted at q ⊨ G(inv_q)); `a & XGb` is caught at the post-a
state (init has none). The GLOBAL front-end peel (project a forced literal
out of the input aut, run the chain, recombine `& G(inv)`; `Fa & Gb` 12→2
census, equiv=True) was DROPPED on purpose — it is the "poor man's" degenerate
case (init-config invariant only) and not the direction we want; per-config
injection above subsumes it when/if pursued.

## 2026-06-17 — session: tool-first docs, contract/combinator refactors, decomp/ + kr→bls reorg

Cleared from TODO.md as DONE:
- Root README rewritten tool-first (+ rendered example image docs/img/); aut2ltl/README.md
  source map added; bls/README rewritten as a current source map.
- contract.py split: Translator -> aut2ltl/translator.py (the floor, no implementor
  refs); CascadeTranslator -> aut2ltl/bls/cascade_translator.py; contract.py kept as a
  deprecated shim.
- combinators.py -> first_success.py. result.md folded into the result.py module
  docstring (the .md removed).
- decomp/ regroup: one isolated subpackage per (de)composition approach — scc
  (ex-sccdecomp), strength, acceptance (extracted from portfolio/decompose), inv
  (moved in). daisy/ extracted from the old sl_core (slpeel -> daisy).
- kr engine reorg + rename: members foldered (acc/weak/buchi/cobuchi/muller); operators/
  gathers the reachability operators + Fin(C); the reachability.py shell + README.old
  removed; kr/STATUS -> docs/kr_STATUS.md, the kr TODO folded into this file. Then
  kr/ -> bls/ (the BLS construction names the engine); the general member is `muller`,
  bls.py a deprecated shim.
All verified: CLI + tests/survey SUCCESS + the r4 audit CLEAN throughout.

## 2026-06-18 — heur/fuse2: extracted the size-2 SCC over-approximation (groundwork for retiring sl/)

The f2 size-2 non-accepting-SCC over-approximation heuristic (legacy
`aut2ltl/sl/heuristics/size2_overapprox.py::try_size2_overapprox`) moved to a new
theme package `aut2ltl/heur/` (pattern-matching heuristics) as `heur/fuse2`.

WHY: the portfolio rework wants `sl/` and the current `portfolio/` contents to
disappear entirely (all of sl is covered by `daisy`, a stronger version of the same
self-loop labeling). f2 was the one piece of sl with no daisy equivalent, so it is
lifted out first, cleanly, with no dependency on `sl/`.

WHAT: reframed HONESTLY as what it is — a gated TGBA->TGBA rewrite, NOT a Translator
(produces no LTL). `fuse2(aut) -> twa_graph | None`: find one non-accepting 2-state
SCC, unfold it once over-approximating the satellite self-loop to true, return the
result ONLY if `spot.are_equivalent` confirms the language survived. Documented
WIP/immature: best-effort, fires rarely, only ~30% of accepted rewrites actually
linearize into daisy reach (the rest stay multi-state, daisy declines harmlessly) —
the gate guarantees language equality, never the target shape.

CLEANUP vs legacy: `get_true_bdd` formula-translation hack -> `buddy.bddtrue`; one
200-line function -> four typed helpers + a thin gated entry; all F2_TRACE prints
dropped. `tests/heur/test_fuse2.py` proves byte-for-byte behavioral PARITY with the
legacy entry over the 100-formula f2 fixture (0 disagreements, 0 gate failures).

NOT WIRED: nothing imports `heur/` yet; the live pipeline + survey/r4 gates are
untouched. Decision: leave unwired for now, let fuzzing measure whether its absence
costs perf vs the current default before deciding to wire it.
