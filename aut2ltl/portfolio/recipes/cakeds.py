"""cakeds recipe — `cake` with `daisystar` layered into the peel.

Identical in shape to `cake` (a shy `best_of` over the trusted incumbent and one
cheap rich variant), but both peels are the **trio** `daisy → daisy2 → daisystar`
instead of the pair `daisy → daisy2`: the reachability star `daisystar` gets a
turn after the recurrence star `daisy2` and before the floor. So a *rejecting*
star SCC that exits to a sink (the `F(a & Xb)` family — pure `LEAVE`, the
reachability dual `daisy2` deliberately declines) is peeled here instead of
falling through to the bls cascade (a large blob).

  * incumbent: `strength ∘ acceptance` over `daisy_trio`, flooring on `core`
    (partscc, else the one bls cascade) — `best_daisy2` with the trio peel.
  * rich (cheap, no second cascade): `Invariant ∘ Strength ∘ Scc ∘ Invariant ∘ Acc
    ∘ daisy_trio_inv` flooring on `PartScc` ONLY; declines where partscc cannot
    label, so `best_of` falls back to the incumbent.

`best_of`'s significance margin keeps the trusted form unless the rich variant is
significantly smaller. A drop-in A/B for `cake` over `--use cakeds`.
