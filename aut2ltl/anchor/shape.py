"""Structure helpers behind the `anchor` combinator (see algorithm.md).

anchor peels the SCC `C` of the initial state when the component's phase — the
state occupied while the run remains inside `C` — is recoverable from the last
anchor letter. These helpers expose the per-state guard data the read-off
consumes and decide that precondition:

* `init_scc_states` — the states of `C`, the SCC of the initial state.
* `lame_data` — the per-state L/A/M/E split, in one edge pass: `L` (Loop
  letters, self-loop guards), `A` (Anchor letters, in-`C` non-self entering
  guards), `M` (Move letters, in-`C` non-self out-guards) and `exits`
  (`state → [(guard, dst ∉ C)]`).
* `anchored_violation` — the precondition test: P1 (anchors pairwise disjoint)
  and P2 (a loop letter fires no foreign anchor). Returns the reason a test
  fails, or `None` when the component is anchored.
* `reroot` — the `A↓dst` rebase handing an exit target to a child.

All guard work is symbolic (BDD conjunctions against `bddfalse`): no letter
enumeration, cost quadratic in `|C|` and linear in the edges.
