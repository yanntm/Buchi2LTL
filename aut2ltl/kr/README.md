# aut2ltl.kr — cascade engine (automaton → LTL)

`kr` translates a deterministic ω-automaton into an equivalent LTL formula via
the Krohn–Rhodes / holonomy reset cascade, following the construction of Boker,
Lehtinen & Sickert (FoSSaCS 2022). It is algebraic and systematic — no
pattern-matching on the automaton's shape — and produces a hash-consed
`spot.formula` DAG (never serialized internally).

## Architecture

Translation is a family of **`CascadeTranslator` members** composed into a chain.

- **Contract** (`aut2ltl/contract.py`, the floor): `ReconResult` (a formula DAG +
  technique set + OK/DECLINED status) and the `CascadeTranslator` protocol —
  `casc → ReconResult`, with a fixed `name`. A member is a small class
  (singleton instance) that is **self-gating**: it inspects the cascade and
  either returns a language-faithful result or DECLINES; it stamps its own
  `name` into the technique.

- **Members** (`casc → ReconResult`):
  - `acc.py` — `Acc` / `acc`: the bounded ("X-ladder") fragment, by direct
    bounded unroll over a ⊤/⊥ oracle on the input automaton. Orthogonal to the
    reach machinery; declines on any recurrent config.
  - `bls.py` — `Bls` / `bls`: the general case (the full Muller-DNF
    construction). The chain's fallback; accepts every LTL-expressible cascade.
  - `acceptance_dispatch.py` — the direct hierarchy-class forms `buchi`
    (`⋁¬Fin`), `cobuchi` (`⋀Fin`), `weak` (reach-only). *(Being brought into the
    same member shape as `acc`/`bls`.)*

- **Composition** (`aut2ltl/combinators.py`): `first_success([...])` — try the
  members in order, take the first OK, else DECLINE. The dispatch chain
  `acc → weak → buchi → cobuchi → bls` (in `reachability.py`) is one such
  composition; per-member gates are `KR_DISPATCH_*`.

- **Support** (build a formula, *not* translators):
  - `reachability_operators.py` + `fin.py` — the five inductive reachability
    formulas and `Fin(C)` (Lemma 7): the mutually-recursive core.
  - `muller.py` — `assemble_muller_dnf`: the general Δ₂ Muller-DNF over the good
    config sets. `Bls` wraps it.
  - `ltl_builders.py` — hash-consed formula builders, simplify hook, and the
    only place that serializes a DAG to text (`_str_f`).
  - `simplify/` — own simplify/fold passes (context, now-eval, factoring, folds).

## Pipeline

```
spot automaton
  │  decompose_aut  (kr.gap)
  ▼
normalize → deterministic, complete, minimized, state-based-acceptance parity
  → extract one generator per concrete letter (extract.py)
  → GAP / SgpDec holonomy decomposition, parsed back        (kr.gap — see its README)
  ▼
Cascade                              (cascade.py + config_graph.py)
  │  the dispatch chain of CascadeTranslator members         (reachability.py)
  ▼
ReconResult  (hash-consed spot.formula DAG + winning technique)
```

`decompose_aut` and the GAP/SgpDec bridge live in the **`kr.gap`** subpackage
(its own README). `cascade.py` is the data model (levels, state↔config, letter
valuations, `move_config`); `config_graph.py` does the config-automaton analysis
(reachable/accepting configs, good Muller sets).

## Usage

```python
import spot
from aut2ltl.kr import decompose_aut, reconstruct_bls

casc = decompose_aut(spot.formula("G(p -> (q U r))").translate())
phi = reconstruct_bls(casc)            # the dispatch chain, formula DAG out
print(phi)
```

The recommended top-level entry is the portfolio front end
`aut2ltl.portfolio.reconstruct_decomposed(aut)` (automaton in, `ReconResult`
out), which composes `kr` with the `sl` heuristic gate.

## Dependencies

GAP (≥ 4.12) with the SgpDec package on `PATH`. Install once:
`./aut2ltl/kr/gap/install.sh` (user-local under `~/.gap/pkg`).

- `paper/automata-to-ltl-construction.md` — the construction reference.
- `algorithm.md` — scope/policy and module mapping.
- `STATUS.md` / `TODO.md` — current state / work items.
- `dag_folding.md` — the size-explosion analysis (open research direction).
- Tests live under `tests/kr/` (placed scripts, subprocess-isolated, small
  budgets); `test_kr_r4_audit.py` is the structural gate, `survey_mp_cascade.py`
